## API

ServerAssistantAI provides a powerful [API](https://wiki.code-solutions.dev/serverassistantai/developers/api) for developers to integrate the AI assistant's functionality into their own plugins or applications, as well as create Addons for ServerAssistantAI.

The API is subject to change in future versions as we improve ServerAssistantAI and may result in breakages. You can join our [discord](https://code-solutions.dev/discord) server to make sure you're notified when a breaking change is done/will be done to ServerAssistantAI, so you can update your addons accordingly.
